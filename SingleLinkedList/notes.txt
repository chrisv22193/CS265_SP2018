Notes:
1. To create a new node holding a value, you will want to do something to the effect of:

	SNode<T> *new_node = new SNode<T>(value);
	
2. Setting a node's (a) next node to another node (b) should be done like:

	a->setNextNode(b);
	
3. Setting a node's (a) pointer to the node's next node should be done like:

	a = a->getNextNode();
	 
4. Setting a variable (assumed as type T) to a node's (b) current data value.

	a = b->getData()
	
5. Set a node's (a) next node to another node's (b) next node should be done like:

	a->setNextNode(b->getNextNode());
